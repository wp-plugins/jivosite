Integrate JivoSite code to your website without editing your theme files.

== Description ==

JivoSite (or JivoChat) is a professional live chat for websites that was specifically designed to increase online sales. 

This plugin provides option to integrate JivoSite on your website without editing your theme.

This is a good practice to use a plugin instead of adding code to your theme files because if you update or change your theme, JivoSite code will still be present on your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why not include JivoSite code directly to my theme? =

You don't want to put JivoSite code inside your theme because next time you update or change it, JivoSite code will be gone. You should *never* edit theme files.

= Where do I get my widget id? =

You can get **widget id** in your JivoSite admin panel at [jivosite.ru](http://jivosite.ru/) or [jivochat.com](http://jivochat.com/). See [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jivosite/screenshots/) for details.
